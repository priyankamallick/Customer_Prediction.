# Customer Conversion Prediction!
This project aims to predict customer conversion for an insurance company.
Based on demographic and marketing data I developed a machine learning model that can identify which customers are most likely to purchase a policy.
By understanding the patterns and behaviors of customers, the model can make predictions and provide valuable insight to the company.
